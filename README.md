# 🏥 Hospital Analysis Dashboard: Operational & Financial Deep Dive (Power BI Project)

## 🌟 Executive Summary

This project showcases a comprehensive, end-to-end business intelligence solution for modern hospital management, developed entirely in Power BI. It transforms raw, static Excel data into a dynamic, interactive suite of dashboards covering key operational domains: **Patient Flow**, **Doctor Performance**, **Operational Charges**, and **Financial Health**.

The primary objective is to move beyond simple reporting by providing granular, cross-functional visibility that facilitates data-driven decision-making. The dashboard suite features five distinct pages, enabling hospital leadership to monitor daily operations and strategic long-term performance simultaneously.

## 💾 Data Source & Preparation

The analysis is powered by a structured dataset sourced from **Microsoft Excel**.

* **Source Files:** The data was ingested and modeled directly from Excel workbooks, representing various facets of hospital operations (e.g., Patient Records, Medicine Inventory, Doctor Salaries, and Billing Logs).
* **Data Preparation (Power Query):** The data underwent rigorous cleaning, transformation, and shaping within Power BI's Power Query Editor to ensure integrity, consistency, and optimal performance for visualization.
* **Data Modeling:** A robust star schema or similar relational model was established to link fact tables (e.g., Charges, Sales) with dimension tables (e.g., Patients, Doctors, Dates), enabling complex cross-filtering and accurate aggregation across all dashboard pages.

### 2. Patients Page Analysis (Page 3)

* **Patient Charges:** Breaks down individual patient charges by category (e.g., Surgery 25K, Room 10K, Test 5K).
* **Medicine Sale (QTY):** Ranks medicines purchased by the patient, with **Omeprazole** and **Paracetamol** as top items.
* **Patient Feedback:** Captures qualitative insights such as wait times and treatment satisfaction.

---

### 3. Doctor Page Analysis (Page 4)

* **Commission Rate:** Displays each doctor’s commission percentage (e.g., Dr. Aditya Gupta: 10%).

## ✅ Future Enhancements

* **DAX Optimization:** Further refining complex DAX measures for quicker rendering and performance.
* **Security Integration:** Implementing Row-Level Security (RLS) to restrict data views based on the user's role (e.g., a doctor only sees their patient data).
* **Web Integration:** Publishing the dashboard to the Power BI Service for broader organizational access and mobile viewing.
